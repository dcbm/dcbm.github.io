      <description>Do some VDA with sights of Vienna, Austria.So what should I visit when staying in Vienna?
I heard this question quite often when friends were visiting from different countries.My Answer was always, if you are only one or two days in Vienna, just talk a long walk inthe city center and enjoy the flare of the city, since the most pretty buildings are around thecity center and mostly in walking distance.</description>
